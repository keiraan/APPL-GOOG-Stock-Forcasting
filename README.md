# Stock-Forcasting
In our project, we collected stock trading data for Apple and Google in the S&amp;P500 for the period 2006-01-01 to 2017-12-01. We chose Apple and Google because both companies experienced dramatic growth during this period and the dataset is more complete than some startups. Stock prices are constantly changing with the performance of the companies. Therefore, we are interested in what the stock prices of Apple and Google are. Therefore, we use time series to predict future stock prices (high) based on their historical data.
In the time series analysis conducted for our project, we use the highest price (high price) as the target variable. Each weekday data can be tricky because it is a very short period of time. And stock companies can stop trading due to various unpredictable events, so let's use monthly averages. We will use the resample function for the conversion. We end up with the average high price data for each month.
